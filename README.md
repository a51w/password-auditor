# password-auditor

A self-developed project created to practice **penetration tester skills** by building a simple Python tool that evaluates password strength.  
This project is for **educational and training purposes only** and was tested on **sample datasets and local VM environments**.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
The **Password Strength Auditor** reads a list of passwords from a file and performs basic security analysis:

- Calculates **entropy** as a measure of password strength  
- Classifies passwords as **Weak / Moderate / Strong**  
- Checks against a list of **common / blacklisted passwords**  
- Detects and reports **duplicate passwords**  
- Generates reports in **CSV and JSON** formats  

This project was built to strengthen skills in **Python programming, security awareness, and penetration testing fundamentals**.
